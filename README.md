# Radical Rhythm Redemption

Radical Rhythm Redemption was conceived as a project in response to the prompt "retro game with unconventional controls" for my Game Design class. Rather than using a traditonal keyboard/mouse or console controller, the player must use a microphone to provide input to this 80's inspired rhythm game.

I worked with Justina Ampofo and Evan Brook to design and implement this game, working as the sole programmer.

# Instructions to Download/Play

To play, download the repository and then, based on your operating system, do one of the following:
(Please note that for all operating systems the game requires a microphone to play, and since there is in-game audio, you're best off with a headphones/microphone combo of some sort)

For Windows players, the game executable is listed under the "Retro Game" directory.
For Mac players, the game executable is listed under the "Retro Game.app/Contents/MacOS" directory.


# Things We Didn't Get To

As with many games created for school projects, we didn't necessarily have the timeline that would have benefitted this game. We had many ideas for adding a high score table, uploading your own songs to play with, and further enhancements to the controls. As a fledgling project by college students just getting into game design, however, I think it turned out pretty well and greatly enjoyed working on it.
